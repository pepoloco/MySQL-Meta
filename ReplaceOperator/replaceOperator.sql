-- Task 1: Write a SQL REPLACE statement that inserts two new orders with the following details:
-- Order 9 data:
-- OrderID = 9, 
-- ClientID = "Cl1", 
-- ProductID = "P1", 
-- Quantity = 10, 
-- Cost = 5000

-- Order 10 data:
-- OrderID = 10, 
-- ClientID = "Cl2", 
-- ProductID = "P2", 
-- Quantity = 5, 
-- Cost = 100
-- Once you have executed the SQL statement, you can select all available data in the Orders table. 

-- Task 2: Lucky Shrub have noticed that the cost of order number 9 is $5000. This is a mistake.
--The order must cost $500. You must help them to change it to $500 by writing a relevant REPLACE statement. 
-- Once you have executed the SQL statement, select all available data from the Orders table.
